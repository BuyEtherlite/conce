This error is straightforward: the database query is trying to sum a column named `total_amount` on your `finance_invoices` table, but that column doesn't exist.

The error is happening in your Blade view file at this exact spot:

```php
// resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php

...->sum('total_amount')...
```

Hereâ€™s how to fix it, starting with the most likely solution.

-----

### Solution 1: Check for a Typo (Most Likely)

The most common cause is a simple typo. The column in your `finance_invoices` table is probably named something slightly different.

1.  **Find the correct column name.** Look at your database directly or check the migration file that created the `finance_invoices` table (e.g., in `database/migrations/`). The column might be named:

      * `amount`
      * `total`
      * `invoice_total`

2.  **Correct the code.** Once you have the correct name, update the `sum()` method in your Blade file. For example, if the column is actually named `amount`, change the code to this:

    ```php
    // In: resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php

    <div class="h5 mb-0 font-weight-bold text-gray-800">
        {{-- Change 'total_amount' to the correct column name, e.g., 'amount' --}}
        R{{ number_format(\App\Models\Finance\Invoice::where('status', 'paid')->whereMonth('paid_at', now())->sum('amount') ?? 0, 2) }}
    </div>
    ```

### Solution 2: Add the Missing Column

If the `total_amount` column is genuinely missing from your database and it should be there, you need to add it by creating a new migration.

1.  **Create a new migration file** by running this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php artisan make:migration add_total_amount_to_finance_invoices_table --table=finance_invoices
    ```

2.  **Edit the new migration file.** It will be in `database/migrations/`. Add the `total_amount` column inside the `up()` method.

    ```php
    <?php

    use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
    use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

    return new class extends Migration
    {
        public function up(): void
        {
            Schema::table('finance_invoices', function (Blueprint $table) {
                // Add the column. Adjust the type (decimal, integer, etc.) and position as needed.
                $table->decimal('total_amount', 10, 2)->default(0)->after('some_other_column');
            });
        }

        public function down(): void
        {
            Schema::table('finance_invoices', function (Blueprint $table) {
                // This allows you to reverse the migration
                $table->dropColumn('total_amount');
            });
        }
    };
    ```

3.  **Run the migration** to update your database schema:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

After applying either of these solutions, refresh your dashboard page, and the error should be gone.
