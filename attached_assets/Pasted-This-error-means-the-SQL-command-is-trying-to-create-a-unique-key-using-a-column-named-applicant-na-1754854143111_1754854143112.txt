This error means the SQL command is trying to create a unique key using a column named `applicant_name` in the `properties` table, but that column doesn't exist.

The command that failed was:

```sql
alter table `properties` add unique `event_permits_unique_key`(`applicant_name`, `event_type`, `event_date`)
```

This action requires the `properties` table to already have the columns `applicant_name`, `event_type`, and `event_date`. The error `Key column 'applicant_name' doesn't exist` confirms the problem is with the `applicant_name` column.

## How to Fix It

You have two main options depending on your intended database structure.

### Option 1: Add the Missing Column (Most Likely)

The most common reason for this error is that the migration or script to add the `applicant_name` column either failed or was never run. The solution is to add the column to the `properties` table **before** creating the unique key.

1.  **Add the `applicant_name` column.** You'll need to choose an appropriate data type, like `VARCHAR`. The following SQL command adds the column:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `properties` ADD COLUMN `applicant_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
    ```

    *You can adjust `VARCHAR(255)` and `NOT NULL` as needed for your application.*

2.  **Run the original command again.** Now that the column exists, the command to add the unique key will succeed:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `properties` ADD UNIQUE `event_permits_unique_key`(`applicant_name`, `event_type`, `event_date`);
    ```

### Option 2: Correct the Unique Key Definition

If including `applicant_name` in the unique key was a mistake and you only want uniqueness based on `event_type` and `event_date`, you should modify the command.

1.  **Remove `applicant_name` from the key definition.** Change the original command to exclude the non-existent column:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `properties` ADD UNIQUE `event_permits_unique_key`(`event_type`, `event_date`);
    ```

This will create a unique constraint that prevents duplicate entries for the same `event_type` on the same `event_date`, without considering an applicant's name.

Choose the option that matches the intended design of your `properties` table.
