This error occurs because the name you're trying to give your unique index is too long. MySQL and its derivatives like MariaDB have a **64-character limit** for identifier names, which includes table names, column names, and index names.

Your auto-generated index name, `currency_exchange_rates_from_currency_to_currency_effective_date_unique`, is 87 characters long, far exceeding this limit.

**The solution is to specify a shorter, custom name for the index.**

### How to Fix It

The fix depends on where you're defining this constraint. It looks like you're using a web framework with a migration system, such as Laravel, which is the most common cause of this issue.

#### In a Laravel Migration 🐘

Laravel automatically generates index names based on the table, columns, and type of index. When the combination is too long, you must provide a shorter name manually.

Find the line in your migration file (e.g., in `database/migrations/YYYY_MM_DD_xxxxxx_create_currency_exchange_rates_table.php`) that defines the unique constraint.

**Your current code probably looks like this:**

```php
// This generates the long, problematic name
$table->unique(['from_currency', 'to_currency', 'effective_date']);
```

**Change it by passing a shorter name as the second argument:**

```php
// Provide a shorter, custom name for the index
$table->unique(
    ['from_currency', 'to_currency', 'effective_date'],
    'currency_rates_unique' // A much shorter name
);
```

After making this change, run your migrations again.

#### In Raw SQL 🔧

If you are writing the SQL command by hand, simply shorten the index name in your `ALTER TABLE` statement.

**Your current failing SQL:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE `currency_exchange_rates`
ADD UNIQUE `currency_exchange_rates_from_currency_to_currency_effective_date_unique`
(`from_currency`, `to_currency`, `effective_date`);
```

**Change it to use a shorter name:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE `currency_exchange_rates`
ADD UNIQUE `currency_rates_unique` -- Shorter name
(`from_currency`, `to_currency`, `effective_date`);
```

This shorter name is well under the 64-character limit and will resolve the error.
